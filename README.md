# Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to the Algorithm Visualizer, an interactive web application that helps you understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. It was created with the intention of enhancing my knowledge of React and learning TypeScript.

## Features

- Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Selection Sort.
- Adjust the number of elements in the array to see how each algorithm performs on different input sizes.
- Control the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process in real-time.
- Randomize the array with a single click to explore different scenarios.
- Watch as the application visually demonstrates each step of the selected sorting algorithm, providing a deeper understanding of how it works.
- Responsive user interface for an optimal viewing experience on different devices.

## Try It Out

You can experience the Algorithm Visualizer by visiting the [GitHub Pages](https://alextutruong.github.io/sorting-algorithm-visualizer/) link.

### Or if you would like to run it yourself you can follow the instructions below.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlexTuTruong/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd algorithm-visualizer
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the Algorithm Visualizer.

## Usage

1. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. Adjust the number of elements and speed using the input fields and sliders.
3. Click the "Randomize Numbers" button to generate a random array.
    - (This is also done automatically upon changing the number of elements)
4. Hit the "Start Sorting" button to watch the algorithm in action.
